# TripleX.cpp
A simple math game I made in C++ during a coding course

The nuclear missiles of the world have been activated!
Only you can stop them but, you must crack the level X clearance codes.
You must deactivate them using the correct codes to save the planet!

*IMPORTANT* You must enter each digit separately either by pressing enter after each digit
or by putting a space in between each digit and then pressing enter.
